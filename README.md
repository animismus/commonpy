# Topspin Python Scripts 

A miscellaneous collection of helper scripts that I wrote through the years. 

Caveats:  
  - If the script is pritting something, it is usually to the console window that started topspin.  
  - Check py files for information on usage.  
  - Jython versions change very slowly in TS, but they do change. Most of the py2.x is somewhat backwards compatible.
